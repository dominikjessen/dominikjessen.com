## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for product & design from Europe (currently splitting my time between Amsterdam & Hamburg). I used to work as a Product Manager but have since seen the light and returned to Engineering to get my hands dirty again and enjoy some flow time while coding (or curse at my screen when things don't quite work the way they should only to find a small bug somewhere 1 sip of coffee later).

Feel free to reach out to me and visit my website for even more information about me (like what game I'm currently watching or which songs you'll find me vibing to) 👋🏻

## About My Website

I built my website with Astro (🚀), HTML5/CSS3 (including animations), and Tailwind. There is currently still one React component, which I may or may not migrate to Astro as well. Eventually I might write up some of my thoughts on various things more or less related to the tech world, which will then live somewhere on my site too.

I also do want to play around with even more animation stuff and design every now and then.
